    <h1>My Encyclopedia Page</h1>
    <p>I am excited to learn more about web design in the way of designing and
        laying out different buttons and options on the site. I am also curious
        about complex new techniques even though I have to struggled with coding 
        in the past. 

    I am already enjoying what I have learned in this class, and am ready for new
    skills that I can use in the future!
